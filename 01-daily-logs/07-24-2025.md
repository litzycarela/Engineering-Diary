## 🛠️ What I Worked On

- Spent way too much time setting up the templates for this diary but hopefully it will help me learn and grow a bit more.
- Purchased my domain and got the SSL certificate for it! (Check me out at [www.litzy.dev](https://www.litzy.dev) in a couple days!)
- Finished up the Anki Deck making for Unit 1 of Intro to Programming Sophia course for WGU transfer

## 💭 Key Learnings

- Turns out I need to really lock in when it comes to mundane/slightly adminy tasks because my brain can easily wander or multitask since its easy just time-consuming.
- Was able to learn and pickup a bit more of Markdown since I made this diary (inspired by @mirayatech on ig)
- Buying and setting up domains and SSL certificates.
- Reminder on commands like git status/add/diff/commit/branch/merge etc.

## 🧩 Bugs or Blockers

- Thankfully none just wish I had more time but we have to hone in.

## 📚 Game-Changing Resources

- [This Reddit Thread on Deploying Websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/11m2k6s/how_does_one_go_about_hosting_your_own_website/)
- [LetsEncrypt. A website where we can get free SSL certificates](https://letsencrypt.org/)
- MirayaTech on instagram who's templates I've used and adapted for this Engineering Diary. Got the idea from her and so far so good (then again it's only been a day so...)
- [This Git cheatsheet by Github for a refresher on the basics.](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

## 🚀 Next Stops / Tomorrow

- Make Figma mockup of "Under Construction" page for my portfolio site.
- Figure out the branding/layout for my actual portfolio
- Write it out in the project journal I made wihin this diary
- Go through Unit 2 of FES
- Start going through the Unit 1 code of Intro to Programming
