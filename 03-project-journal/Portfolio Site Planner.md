# Project: Cozy Dev Portfolio ✨

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build and deploy a warm, personality-packed portfolio site that showcases my projects, education, and blog content, while also being recruiter and client-friendly.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS + sprinkled React (for components like contact form or blog feed)

- Styling: Tailwind CSS (for fast, pretty UI + easy responsive design)

- Hosting: GitHub Pages (can switch to Netlify/Vercel if blog sync needs more backend support)

- Domain & SSL: Use your custom domain with GitHub Pages and enable SSL via GitHub DNS or Cloudflare

- Blog Integration (optional): Use Hashnode’s RSS feed or their API to auto-pull posts
